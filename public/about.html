<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am currently studying how to become a webdeveloper. I have to say that the challenge is something that I enjoy. You see
  many people tend to start learning but stop when things become difficult. I on the otherhand have found that it's the challenges
  that motivates me to try and overcome the problem at hand. I am currently taking a Udemy course on webdevelopment and this is just
  one of the many projects I will be creating to help build my skills in the various languages a developer needs to know.
</p>

<p>So a little background about myself. I am currently an English teacher with a bachelor degree in Public Relations Communication
  and have recently passed my masters in Marketing Communication. I enjoy teaching very much however, it does take up a lot of Timein my life,
  meaning that I am away from home a lot and cannot spend as much time at home as I would hope. Family is important to me, and having the opportunity
  to work remote doing something I enjoy whilst being able to spend time with my family is a big goal in my life.
</p>

<p>So what is it that webdevlopment can do for me upon learning the skills that are needed? Well, I have a lot of ideas/projects 
  that I would love to try and build. Projects I hope would provide some type of benefit to the people who find their way to them.
  However, in order to do this I believe it is important to learn the basics and then hone my skills to always improve and become better.
